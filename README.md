Cattle Health Monitoring and Disease Diagnosis System
Overview

This project leverages Artificial Intelligence to transform disease diagnosis and reporting for farmers and veterinarians, offering an innovative mobile application that streamlines livestock health management. Developed using React Native and JavaScript, the app is designed to enhance agricultural productivity and ensure sustainable practices by predicting, diagnosing, and addressing cattle health issues effectively.

Features
Dual Login System:

Farmers: Simplified interface to submit health reports and access educational resources.
Veterinarians: Access to detailed reports, data visualizations, and treatment options.
AI-Powered Health Diagnosis:

Farmers are prompted every 7 days (or 3 days during risky conditions) to submit a health report.
Reports include:
Simple Yes/No questions for internal health.
Images of the cattle's skin, mouth, and abdomen for external analysis.
Custom AI algorithms analyze the inputs to detect diseases and provide health insights.
Real-Time Data Integration:

Weather and Location-Based Predictions: Identify region-specific diseases likely to occur based on current environmental conditions.
Notification System: Alerts veterinarians of severe cases, marking affected cattle locations on a map.
Veterinarian Tools:

View region-specific data visualizations (e.g., bar graphs).
Provide remote prescriptions or schedule on-site appointments.
Farmer Empowerment:

Educational resources on disease prevention, natural remedies, and livestock care in PDF format.
Custom comment box for farmers to describe specific issues or ask questions, enabling tailored AI-generated solutions.
Data Integration and Visualization:

Web-scraped data from platforms like 1962 and Bharat Pasudhan for state and district-level livestock analysis.
Key Challenges Addressed
Continuous Monitoring:
Veterinarians often cannot monitor cattle daily. Our app bridges this gap by requiring periodic health reports, ensuring proactive detection and timely interventions.

Customized Disease Detection:

Integrated weather and location data predict diseases likely in the user's region.
Follow-up reports refine diagnoses by focusing on specific symptoms.
Targeted Solutions:

Preventive measures and remedies tailored to the detected issues.
Comment box enables farmers to provide additional details for personalized AI recommendations.
Technology Stack
Frontend: React Native (JavaScript)
AI Model: Custom Vet Model (leveraging OpenAI)
Data Integration: Real-time weather/location APIs and web scraping from relevant livestock platforms
Backend: FastAPI (Python)
How It Works
Farmers' Interaction:

Submit periodic reports with health details and images.
Receive AI-generated health assessments, preventive measures, and remedies.
Access educational resources for better livestock management.
Veterinarians' Interaction:

Get notified of severe cases with real-time map tracking.
Analyze region-wise cattle health through data visualizations.
Provide remote or in-person treatment options.
Vision
This project ensures enhanced disease diagnosis, timely interventions, and community engagement, promoting sustainable agricultural practices and improving farm productivity. By harnessing the power of AI, we aim to empower farmers and veterinarians alike, revolutionizing livestock health management.
