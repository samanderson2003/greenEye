## Overview
Our project addresses this challenge by leveraging Artificial Intelligence to revolutionize disease diagnosis and reporting for farmers and veterinarians. We have developed a mobile application using React Native and JavaScript, designed with two distinct logins: one for farmers and another for veterinarians. The app integrates real-time location and weather data to predict region-specific diseases that may arise based on current conditions. Every 7 days, farmers are prompted to submit a health report for their cattle, answering simple yes/no questions to assess internal health and uploading three images—of the skin, mouth, and abdomen—for external disease detection. The app analyzes this data using AI algorithms to determine the health status of the cattle. If any abnormalities or diseases are detected, the app provides preventive measures and, in severe cases, automatically notifies nearby veterinarians, marking the affected cattle's location on a map for real-time tracking. Veterinarians can access detailed reports, view affected regions through data visualizations like bar graphs, and either prescribe treatment remotely or schedule appointments. Additionally, the app empowers farmers by providing educational resources, including PDFs on preventive measures and natural solutions. To support broader integration, we’ve web-scraped data from platforms like 1962 and Bharat Pasudhan, allowing for state and district-level visualization of livestock populations and affected cattle. This innovation ensures enhanced disease diagnosis, timely interventions, and community engagement, promoting sustainable agricultural practices and improving farm productivity.
